This workhorse model---as well as heterogeneous agent models more generally---then boils down to a system of partial differential equations, a fact we take advantage of to make two types of contributions. First, a number of new theoretical results: (1) an analytic characterization of the consumption and saving behaviour of the poor, particularly their marginal propensities to consume; (2) a closed-form solution for the wealth distribution in a special case with two income types; (3) a proof that there is a unique stationary equilibrium if the intertemporal elasticity of substitution is weakly greater than one. Second, we develop a simple, efficient and portable algorithm for numerically solving for equilibria in a wide class of heterogeneous agent models, including---but not limited to---the Aiyagari--Bewley--Huggett model.},

Focusing on a single-hidden-layer artificial neural network, the paper discusses its mathematical underpinnings, including the pivotal Universal Approximation Theorem---an essential ''existence theorem''. The exposition extends to the algorithmic exploration of solutions, specifically through ``feed forward'' and ``back-propagation'', and rounds up with the practical implementation in Python.

Our algorithm is simplest when markets are first-order complete with respect to aggregate shocks; we cover extensions to cases with gross portfolio constraints and/or incomplete markets. Applying our method to a simple HANK model, we show that with endogenous portfolios: a) the effects of monetary shocks and balanced-budget fiscal shocks are unchanged, b) the effects of deficit-financed fiscal shocks are attenuated greatly when portfolios are unconstrained, but modestly when we impose short-sale constraints, and c) the covariance between MPCs and nominal positions is more realistic, and hence nominal asset redistribution matters much less than in the standard model. Overall, we find that the aggregate implications of optimal portfolios tend to be large whenever high-MPC agents are allowed to take large gross positions.},

Since the neural network approximates the equilibrium functions directly, simulating the economy is computationally cheap, and training data can be generated at virtually zero cost.  We demonstrate that deep equilibrium nets can solve rich and economically relevant models accurately by applying them to solve three different models, all featuring a very high-dimensional state space. Specifically, we solve two overlapping generations models with aggregate and idiosyncratic uncertainty, illiquid capital, a one-period bond, and occasionally binding constraints. Additionally, we solve a Bewley-style model with a continuum of agents, aggregate and idiosyncratic risk, borrowing constraints, and recursive preferences.},

We analytically derive the coefficients of these linear systems and show that they satisfy simple recursive relations, making their numerical implementation quick and efficient. Compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques, our method is faster in constructing first-order approximations and extends to higher orders, capturing the effects of risk that are ignored by many current methods.

Treating the underlying distribution as an explicit state variable, a single value function defined on an infinite-dimensional state space provides a fully recursive representation of the economy: the `Master Equation' introduced in the mathematics mean field games literature. I show that analytic local perturbations of the Master Equation around steady-state deliver dramatic simplifications. The First-order Approximation to the Master Equation (FAME) reduces to a standard Bellman equation for the directional derivatives of the value function with respect to the distribution and aggregate shocks. The FAME has six main advantages: (i) finite dimension; (ii) closed-form mapping to steady-state objects; (iii) applicability when many distributional moments or prices enter individuals' decision such as dynamic trade, urban or job ladder settings; (iv) block-recursivity bypassing further fixed points; (v) mapping to analytic sequence-space derivatives; (vi) fast implementation using standard numerical methods. I develop the Second-order Approximation to the Master Equation (SAME) and show that it shares these properties, making the approach amenable to settings such as asset pricing. I apply the method to two economies: an incomplete market model with unemployment and a wage ladder, and a discrete choice spatial model with migration.},

This risk makes the economy transition between a high-leverage region and a low-leverage region, which, in turn, creates state dependence in impulse responses: the same shock starting from the high-leverage region gets propagated and amplified more than when the shock arrives when leverage is low. State dependence in impulse responses generates a time-varying aggregate precautionary savings motive that, by moving the risk-free rate, justifies the leverage level of the financial sector in each region.

  abstract = {How do asset returns interact with wealth inequality? Empirical evidence shows that portfolio choices and financial constraints lead to unequal risk exposure across households and financial intermediaries. To understand the dynamic general equilibrium implications, we build a macroeconomic model with heterogeneous households, a financial sector, asset market participation constraints, and endogenous asset price volatility. We develop a new deep learning methodology for characterizing global solutions to this class of macro-finance models. We show that wealth inequality, financial sector recovery, and asset price dynamics depends on which households are able to purchase assets during crisis. This means the government faces a trade-off between tighter leverage constraints and a more equal recovery. In our calibrated model, asset returns and participation constraints account for a large fraction of the change in wealth inequality over the past half-century.},

We consider different approximations: discretizing the number of agents, discretizing the agent state variables, and projecting the distribution onto a finite set of basis functions. Second, we represent the value function using a neural network and train it to solve the differential equation using deep learning tools. We refer to the solution as an Economic Model Informed Neural Network (EMINN). The main advantage of this technique is that it allows us to find global solutions to high dimensional, non-linear problems.

Second, it provides a general and interpretable representation of the distribution over individual states, which is crucial in addressing the classical question of whether and how heterogeneity matters in macroeconomics.

This result is robust to substantial changes in both parameter values and model specification. Our benchmark model, whose only difference from the representative-agent framework is the existence of uninsurable idiosyncratic risk, displays far less cross-sectional dispersion and skewness in wealth than U.S. data. However, an extension that relies on a small amount of heterogeneity in thrift does succeed in replicating the key features of the wealth data.

When there is common noise, this assumption results in the ``Master equation'' (a.k.a. ``Monster equation''), a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation in which the infinite-dimensional density of agents is a state variable. The rational expectations assumption and the implication that agents solve Master equations is unrealistic in many applications. We show how to instead formulate MFGs with non-rational expectations. Departing from rational expectations is particularly relevant in ``MFGs with a low-dimensional coupling'', i.e. MFGs in which agents' running reward function depends on the density only through low-dimensional functionals of this density. This happens, for example, in most macroeconomics MFGs in which these low-dimensional functionals have the interpretation of ``equilibrium prices.'' In MFGs with a low-dimensional coupling, departing from rational expectations allows for completely sidestepping the Master equation and for instead solving much simpler finite-dimensional HJB equations. We introduce an adaptive learning model as a particular example of non-rational expectations and discuss its properties.},

  abstract = {I extend traditional projection methods by using neural networks as a function approximator to solve continuous-time models. The method is well-suited for high-dimensional settings such as those that arise in the presence of many assets, and can capture the strong non-linearities that occur for instance when agents face constraints. It is designed to accommodate multiple unknown functions, e.g. multiple value functions, so that it is set to tackle economies with several agents and incomplete markets.~The technical apparatus that comes with neural networks (e.g., automatic differentiation, just-in-time compiling) can also be used in a hybrid fashion by combining it with more standard polynomials, in order to make use of their good convergence properties while speeding up the resolution and increasing the dimensionality.},

  abstract = {This paper develops a simulation-based solution method to solve large state space macrofinance models using machine learning. We use a neural network (NN) to approximate the expectations in the optimality conditions in the spirit of the stochastic parameterized expectations algorithm (PEA). Because our method can process the entire information set at once, it is scalable and can handle models with large and multicollinear state spaces. We demonstrate the computational gains by extending the optimal government debt management problem studied by Faraglia et al. (2019) from two to three maturities. We find that the optimal policy prescribes an active role for the newly added medium-term maturity, enabling the planner to raise financial income without increasing its total borrowing in response to expenditure shocks. Through this mechanism the government effectively subsidizes the private sector in recessions, resulting in a welfare gain of 2.38\% when the number of available maturities increases from two to three.},
