# Incomplete Markets

This repository contains MATLAB code for solving a continuous time incomplete markets model under different equilibrium concepts. The model can be solved in:

- Partial equilibrium
- General equilibrium Aiyagari-style with capital
- General equilibrium Huggett-style with bonds

## Structure

- `Matlab/`: Core model code and calibration routines.
- `Paper/`: LaTeX source and compiled PDF describing the model.

## Getting Started

1. Open `Matlab/main1_cali.m`.
2. Choose the equilibrium mode using the provided switch.
3. Run the script to solve the model and generate output.

## Documentation

A detailed description of the model and solution methods is available in the [model PDF](Paper/model.pdf).
